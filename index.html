						<p> &emsp;&emsp;Greetings, my name is Ben Thrun I am an Aerospace Engineering Student
							at Illinois Institute of Technology. I will be graduating in December 2020 with a Bachelor of
							Science in Aerospace Engineering and a Master of Engineering in Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering.
							I am currently working as a Graduate Research Assistant under Dr. David Williams, where
							I am using a miniCTA Hotwire Anemometer and Aeroprobe to model the characteristic traits
							of a test section in a newly constructed wind tunnel.
						</p>
						
						<p> &emsp;&emsp;My goal is to obtain a career which constantly challenges me and allows
							me to develop and hone my skills as an engineer. I am very passionate about learning and applying the knowledge 
							I've gained in meaningful ways to my work, which can be demonstrated by the various projects I've worked on.
							I have been lucky in the experiences and education I've recieved. Everything I have achieved has been through 
							hardwork, detrmination, and proper guidance. Some topics I am interested in include: aeronautics, fluid mechanics, and data modeling. 
							The purpose behind this website is to act as a cool place to show some of the "projects" that I
							have worked on; as well as a learning experience in HTML and CSS. </p>

						<p> &emsp;&emsp;Outside of academics my hobbies include: playing musical instruments, camping, playing basketball,
							and baking! The folk band that I was apart of <em>"Walking for the Gumbo"</em> (pictured to the left), won
							first place in the Seneca talent show and third place in the Grundy County Fair talent show. </p>
