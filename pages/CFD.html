						<p>The final homework for my Computational Fluid Dyanmics course required the creation of a solver
                            for the flow in a driven cavity. This problem set gave me two eqations, a vorticity-transport equation,
                            and a Poisson equation for the streamfunction. In order to determine the vorticity-streamfunction formulation I had
                            to use code developed in past homeworks where I created an ADI Poisson solver 
                            and an ADI algorithm for the scalar transport equation I developed develop an iterative
                            algorithm to solve the coupled equations. This problem set was relatively short as I was able to rely on the past homework assignments
                            which was significantly more time consuming due to having create all of the code from scratch. I was able 
                            to produce a solution to the driven cavity problem which was very satisfactory. All of the coding done was 
                            in python.  </p>
