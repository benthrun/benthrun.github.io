						The aircraft design course I took had a project which required obtaining a solution to the AIAA design competition.
                            			The team I was on was tasked with several different performance metrics to meet, such as takeoff and landing distances, minimum cpacity, etc.
						
						<br></br>
						I specifically worked on the Propulsion as well as  Aerodyanmic Performance. XFLR5 and MATLAB were softwares that I worked with
                            			to obtain useful information and manipulate data. Some of the tasks done I performed required making various trade studies as well as developing the flight envelope.
						
						<br></br>
						The team was succesful in producing an effective design, and was able to meet all of the performance metrics laid out in the Request for Proposal (RFP).
